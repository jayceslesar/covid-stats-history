0,Reproductive number of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on global level evidence,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111021,"Background The coronavirus (COVID-19) is now a global concern because of its higher transmission capacity and associated adverse consequences including death. The reproductive number of COVID-19 provides an estimate on the possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide the average reproductive number of COVID-19 based on available global level evidence. Methods We searched three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct) to find studies reported the reproductive number of COVID-19. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy that includes keywords of COVID-19 and its reproductive number related terms, which were combined using the Boolean operators. Narrative synthesis was used to explain the studies included and the meta-analysis was used to estimate the average reproduction number of COVID-19. Results Total of 30 studies included in this review whereas 24 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The average estimated reproductive number was 2.70 (95% CI, 2.21-3.30). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive numbers reported in the included studies. The highest reproductive number was reported for Diamond Princes Cruise Ship, Japan (14.8). In the country-level, the higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.98) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 5.08, 95% CI, 4.50-5.73). We also found estimation models, methods, and the number of cases considered to estimate reproductive number were played a role in arising the heterogeneity of the estimated reproductive number. Conclusion The estimated reproductive number indicates an exponential increase of COVID-19 infection in the coming days. Comprehensive policies and programs are important to reduce new infections as well as the associated adverse consequences including death.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['University Malaysia Terengganu', 'Khulna University of Engineering and Technology', 'Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
1,Worldwide and Regional Forecasting of Coronavirus (Covid-19) Spread using a Deep Learning Model,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111039,"In December 2019, Covid-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China. Covid-19 may cause fatality especially among elderly, and people with chronic health problems. After human to human transmissions of the disease, it has rapidly spread throughout China, and then the outbreak has reached to neighboring countries in Asia. Now, the spread of the virus is accelerating in the world, and increasing number of new cases has been reported daily in Europe, Middle East, Africa and America regions. Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) also announced Covid-19 as a Pandemic. As of 3 April, worldwide around more than 1 million cases and around 60,000 fatalities are reported. Thus, forecasting regional and worldwide outbreak size of Covid-19 is important in order to take necessary actions regarding to preparedness plans and mitigation interventions. In this work, we design a deep learning model, which is an effective artificial intelligence method, to provide regional and worldwide forecasts. Particularly for worldwide, our approach predicts the cumulative number of cases, cumulative number of deaths and daily new cases. For Europe and Middle East regions, we predict the cumulative number of cases, and for Mainland China we predict daily new cases and the cumulative number of deaths. We predict the next 10 days based on the previously reported actual time series data of Covid-19. For worldwide forecasts, we use the data provided by Worldometers. For Europe and Middle East forecasts, we use the data provided by World Health Organization, and for China Mainland forecasts, the data is obtained from Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the first time that a deep learning model has been employed for Covid-19 spread prediction, solely based on the known reported cases of Covid-19. The proposed deep learning architecture consists of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layers to predict regional and worldwide forecasts. We evaluate our approach with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. For forecasting, we use the network models that give the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days of actual data. Networks, which achieves the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days, are used to predict the next 10 days. Every day, the spread and situations are changing. Our approach can take into account these real-time changes; the deep learning model can be re-trained with new daily data and perform real-time forecasting. Results show that the proposed deep learning model is promising, it can predict possible scenarios regionally and globally for the spread of Covid-19.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['Middle East Technical University - Northern Cyprus Campus', 'Near East University']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
2,Tensions between research and public health: modelling the risks and benefits of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine field trials versus human infection challenge studies.,10.1101/2020.05.18.20106187,"Background: Human infection challenge studies (HICS) with SARS-CoV-2 are under consideration as a way of accelerating vaccine development. We evaluate potential vaccine research strategies under a range of epidemic conditions determined, in part, by the intensity of public health interventions. Methods: We constructed a compartmental epidemiological model incorporating public health interventions, vaccine efficacy trials and a post-trial population vaccination campaign. The model was used to estimate the duration and benefits of large-scale field trials in comparison with HICS accompanied by an expanded safety trial, and to assess the marginal risk faced by HICS participants. Results: Field trials may demonstrate vaccine efficacy more rapidly than a HICS strategy under epidemic conditions consistent with moderate mitigation policies. A HICS strategy is the only feasible option for testing vaccine efficacy under epidemic suppression, and maximises the benefits of post-trial vaccination. Less successful or absent mitigation results in minimal or no benefit from post-trial vaccination, irrespective of trial design. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 HICS are the optimal method of vaccine testing for populations maintained under epidemic suppression, where vaccination offers the greatest benefits to the local population.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,['Monash University'],,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
3,"Evaluating the burden of COVID-19 on hospital resources in Bahia, Brazil: A modelling-based analysis of 14.8 million individuals",10.1101/2020.05.25.20105213,"Here we present a general compartment model with a time-varying transmission rate to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic, parameterized with the demographics of Bahia, a state in northeast Brazil. The dynamics of the model are influenced by the number of asymptomatic cases, hospitalization requirements and mortality due to the disease. A locally-informed model was determined using actual hospitalization records. Together with cases and casualty data, optimized estimates for model parameters were obtained within a metaheuristic framework based on Particle Swarm Optimization. Our strategy is supported by a statistical sensitivity analysis on the model parameters, adequate to properly account for the simulated scenarios. First, we evaluated the effect of previously enforced interventions on the transmission rate. Then, we studied its effects on the number of deaths as well as hospitalization requirements, considering the state as a whole. Special attention is given to the impact of asymptomatic individuals on the dynamic of COVID-19 transmission, as these were estimated to contribute to a 68% increase in the basic reproductive number. Finally, we delineated scenarios that can set guides to protect the health care system, particularly by keeping demand below total bed occupancy. Our results underscore the challenges related to maintaining a fully capable health infrastructure during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, specially in a low-resource setting such as the one focused in this work. The evidences produced by our modelling-based analysis show that decreasing the transmission rate is paramount to success in maintaining health resources availability, but that current local efforts, leading to a 38% decrease in the transmission rate, are still insufficient to prevent its collapse at peak demand. Carefully planned and timely applied interventions, that result in stark decreases in transmission rate, were found to be the most effective in preventing hospital bed shortages for the longest periods.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health, Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz', 'Instituto de Fisica, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brazi', 'enter of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil', 'Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Porto Velho, Rondonia, Brazil', 'College of Engineering, Swansea University, Swansea, Wales, United Kingdom', 'Instituto de Matematica e Estatistica, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil', 'Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil', 'Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, United States of America', '']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
4,A Noncooperative Game Analysis for Controlling COVID-19 Outbreak,10.1101/2020.05.22.20110783,"COVID-19 is a global epidemic. Till now, there is no remedy for this epidemic. However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective to control this pandemic. In this paper, we provide an analytical model on the effectiveness of the sustainable lockdown policy that accommodates both isolation and social distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we analyze a noncooperative game environment that provides an incentive for maintaining social distancing. Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is also interpreted with the help of a game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social distancing. Finally, an extensive numerical analysis is provided to study the impact of maintaining a social-distancing measure to prevent the Covid-19 outbreak. Numerical results show that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The numerical results also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home isolation, the individual incentive decreases with an increasing number of individuals.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Rep. of Korea and Computer Science and Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna-9208, Bangladesh', 'Department of Computer Science, Taif University, Taif, KSA', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Rep. of Korea', 'Computer Science and Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna-9208, Bangladesh', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Faridpur Engineering College, Faridpur, Bangladesh', 'Department of Information Technology, Taif University, Taif, KSA', 'Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77004, USA and also Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyung Hee']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
5,Bayesian modeling of COVID-19 cases with a correction to account for under-reported cases,10.1101/2020.05.24.20112029,"The novel of COVID-19 disease started in late 2019 making the worldwide governments came across a high number of critical and death cases, beyond constant fear of the collapse in their health systems. Since the beginning of the pandemic, researchers and authorities are mainly concerned with carrying out quantitative studies (modeling and predictions) overcoming the scarcity of tests that lead us to under- reporting cases. To address these issues, we introduce a Bayesian approach to the SIR model with correction for under-reporting in the analysis of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. The proposed model was enforced to obtain estimates of important quantities such as the reproductive rate and the average infection period, along with the more likely date when the pandemic peak may occur. Several under-reporting scenarios were considered in the simulation study, showing how impacting is the lack of information in the modeling.",5/25/2020,medrxiv,"['UFMT', 'Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso', 'Universidade Federal de Maring']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
6,Modelling information-dependent social behaviors in response to lockdowns: the case of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy,10.1101/2020.05.20.20107573,"The COVID-19 pandemic started in January 2020 has not only threatened world public health, but severely impacted almost every facet of lives including behavioral and psychological aspects. In this paper we focus on the 'human element' and propose a mathematical model to investigate the effects on the COVID-19 epidemic of social behavioral changes in response to lockdowns. We consider a SEIR-like epidemic model where that contact and quarantine rates are assumed to depend on the available information and rumors about the disease status in the community. The model is applied to the case of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. We consider the period that stretches between February 24, 2020 when the first bulletin by the Italian Civil Protection was reported and May 18, 2020 when the lockdown restrictions have been mostly removed. The role played by the information-related parameters is determined by evaluating how they affect suitable outbreak-severity indicators. We estimated that citizens compliance with mitigation measures played a decisive role in curbing the epidemic curve by preventing a duplication of deaths and about 46% more contagions.",5/25/2020,medrxiv,"['University of Naples Federico II', 'University of Parma']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
7,Can a herd immunity strategy become a viable option against COVID-19? A model-based analysis on social acceptability and feasibility,10.1101/2020.05.19.20107524,"This paper studies the social acceptability and feasibility of ""herd immunity"" strategies against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To this end, we propose a control scheme that aims to develop herd immunity while satisfying the following two basic requirements for a viable policy option. The first requirement is social acceptability: the overall deaths should be minimized for social acceptance. The second is feasibility: the healthcare system should not be overwhelmed to avoid diverse adverse effects. Exploiting the fact that the severity of the disease increases considerably with age, the proposed control scheme protects high-risk individuals that mainly consist of the elderly. The protection of high-risk individuals reduces the average severity of the disease in the unprotected population, thereby substantially reducing mortality and avoiding the collapse of the healthcare system. Social acceptability (in terms of the resulting mortality) and feasibility (in terms of the healthcare system capacity) of the proposed herd immunity strategy are summarized into two respective, easily computable conditions by building on a simple susceptible--infected--recovered (SIR) model. For its parsimony, the proposed framework can provide a rule of thumb that applies to various populations for studying the viability of herd immunity strategies against COVID-19. For Japan, herd immunity may be developed by the considered control scheme if R0 [&le;] 2.0 and the severity rates of the disease are 1/10 times smaller than the previously reported value, although as high mortality as seasonal influenza is expected.",5/25/2020,medrxiv,"['Tohoku University', 'Kyoto University']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
8,"Eat, Pray, Work: A meta-analysis of COVID-19 Transmission Risk in Common Activities of Work and Leisure",10.1101/2020.05.22.20110726,"ABSTRACT. BACKGROUND. When the lockdowns are relaxed, the responsibility of mitigating the COVID-19 spread shifts from the governments to the individuals. To know how to conduct one-self, it is important for everyone to know the risks of transmission during the quotidian activities - meetings, meals, etc, from individuals who are known to them and looking healthy. METHODS. The detailed case-studies corresponding to 425 infections upon point-exposures over a specified duration are curated. The data from the case studies is summarized and reorganized to reflect different situations from the daily life. A meta-analysis of the attack rates of transmission and the number of infections per infected person are performed. RESULTS. The attack rates are very high in family dinners (66.7% (48.8-80.8%)) compared to sit-down dinners with lesser mixing among people eating at different tables (15.7% (12.1-20.1%)), both lasting a couple of hours. In an open workspace office floor organized in a two-half structure with shared elevators and restrooms and the employees speaking continuously, the average attack rate over the course of a few days was much higher in one half (78.7% (70.3-85.3%)) than the one for the entire floor (43.5% (37.0-50.1%)). Inferred data suggests that the transmission in elevators and trains may be lower under the conditions of using masks. In most of the instances we studied, the infected individuals spreading (35/44) and even super-spreading (3/6) were mostly without symptoms of coughing, sneezing or a fever. CONCLUSIONS. Although the basic reproduction number R0 is around 3.0, the number of infections caused, including the super-spreading events, seem to be limited by the number of personal interactions in a group and their proximity. By acknowledging the risks in daily life, from healthy-looking persons, one may be able to organize their interactions better to reduce the chances of spreading or super-spreading infections.",5/24/2020,medrxiv,['Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research'],,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
9,Epidemiological monitoring and control perspectives: application of a parsimonious modelling framework to the COVID-19 dynamics in France,10.1101/2020.05.22.20110593,"SARS-Cov-2 virus has spread over the world creating one of the fastest pandemics ever. The absence of immunity, asymptomatic transmission, and the relatively high level of virulence of the COVID-19 infection it causes led to a massive flow of patients in intensive care units (ICU). This unprecedented situation calls for rapid and accurate mathematical models to best inform public health policies. We develop an original parsimonious model that accounts for the effect of the age of infection on the natural history of the disease. Analysing the ongoing COVID-19 in France, we estimate the value of the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number (R0), and the efficiency of the national control strategy. We then use our deterministic model to explore several scenarios posterior to lock-down lifting and compare the efficiency of non pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) described in the literature.",5/24/2020,medrxiv,"['MIVEGEC (Univ.
