0,Reproductive number of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on global level evidence,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111021,"Background The coronavirus (COVID-19) is now a global concern because of its higher transmission capacity and associated adverse consequences including death. The reproductive number of COVID-19 provides an estimate on the possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide the average reproductive number of COVID-19 based on available global level evidence. Methods We searched three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct) to find studies reported the reproductive number of COVID-19. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy that includes keywords of COVID-19 and its reproductive number related terms, which were combined using the Boolean operators. Narrative synthesis was used to explain the studies included and the meta-analysis was used to estimate the average reproduction number of COVID-19. Results Total of 30 studies included in this review whereas 24 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The average estimated reproductive number was 2.70 (95% CI, 2.21-3.30). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive numbers reported in the included studies. The highest reproductive number was reported for Diamond Princes Cruise Ship, Japan (14.8). In the country-level, the higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.98) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 5.08, 95% CI, 4.50-5.73). We also found estimation models, methods, and the number of cases considered to estimate reproductive number were played a role in arising the heterogeneity of the estimated reproductive number. Conclusion The estimated reproductive number indicates an exponential increase of COVID-19 infection in the coming days. Comprehensive policies and programs are important to reduce new infections as well as the associated adverse consequences including death.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['University Malaysia Terengganu', 'Khulna University of Engineering and Technology', 'Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
1,Enveloped Virus Inactivation on Personal Protective Equipment by Exposure to Ozone,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111435,"Ozone is a highly oxidizing gas easily generated from atmospheric oxygen with inexpensive equipment and is commonly used for the disinfection of municipal water, foods, and surfaces. We report tests of the ability of ozone to inactivate enveloped respiratory viruses (influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus), chosen as more easily handled surrogates for SARS-CoV-2, on N95 respirators and other personal protective equipment (PPE) commonly used in hospitals. At 20 ppm, an ozone concentration easily achieved by standard commercial equipment, the viruses were inactivated with high efficiency as long as the relative humidity was above a threshold value of approximately 50%. In the absence of humidity control, disinfection is more variable and requires considerably longer exposure under relatively dry conditions. This report extends the observations of a previous publication (http://doi.org/10.1080/01919510902747969) to hospital-relevant materials and provides additional details about the relationship of humidity to the antiviral activity of ozone. Home CPAP disinfection devices using ozone can provide effective results for individuals. Ozone did not appear to degrade any of the materials tested except for elastic bands if strained during treatment (such as by the pressure exerted by stapled attachment to N95 respirators). The filtration efficiency of N95 respirator material was not compromised.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,['Georgia Institute of Technology'],,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
2,Estimation of the case fatality rate based on stratification for the COVID-19 outbreak,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111484,"This work is motivated by the recent worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). When an epidemiological disease is prevalent, estimating the case fatality rate, the proportion of deaths out of the total cases, accurately and quickly is important as the case fatality rate is one of the crucial indicators of the risk of a disease. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator of the case fatality rate that provides more accurate estimate during an outbreak by reducing the downward bias (underestimation) of the naive CFR, the proportion of deaths out of confirmed cases at each time point, which is the most commonly used estimator due to the simplicity. The proposed estimator is designed to achieve the availability of real-time update by using the commonly reported quantities , the numbers of confirmed, cured, deceased cases, in the computation. To enhance the accuracy, the proposed estimator adapts a stratification, that allows the estimator to use information from heterogeneous strata separately. With the COVID-19 cases of China, South Korea and the United States, we numerically show the proposed stratification-based estimator plays a role of providing an early warning about the severity of a epidemiological disease that estimates the final case fatality rate accurately and shows faster convergence to the final case fatality rate.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,['Seoul National University'],,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,

The number of affected cases growing exponentially and now, more than 210 countries confirmed the cases. Objective: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate risk factors, the prevalence of comorbidity, and clinical characteristics in COVID-19 death patients compared to survival patients that can be used as a reference for further research and clinical decisions. Methods: PubMed, Science Direct, SAGE were searched to collect data about demographic, clinical characteristics, and comorbidities of confirmed COVID-19 patients from January 1, 2020, to May 17, 2020. Meta-analysis was performed with the use of Review Manager 5.3 Results: Eighty-five studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 67,299 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Males are severely affected or died than females (OR = 2.26, p < 0.00001; OR = 3.59, p < 0.00001) are severely affected, or died by COVID-19 and cases with age [&ge;]50 are at higher risk of death than age <50 years (OR=334.23).

Data from 5,393 individuals were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model was fitted. The 7-day survival was 0.822 and went to 0.482, 0.280, and 0.145 on days 15, 21, and 30 of hospital stay, respectively. In the multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of dying were: male gender, age, longer disease evolution before hospital entry, exposure to mechanical ventilator support, and personal history of chronic noncommunicable diseases (namely obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the survival probability in a large subset of Latin-American adults with COVID-19 and our results contribute to achieving a better understanding of disease evolution.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['Mexican Institute of Social Security', 'UNIVERSIDAD DE COLIMA']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
5,Are we #stayinghome to Flatten the Curve?,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111211,"The recent spread of COVID-19 across the U.S. led to concerted efforts by states to ``flatten the curve"" through the adoption of stay-at-home mandates that encourage individuals to reduce travel and maintain social distance and indeed using data on travel activity we find that residents start reducing mobility early in most states. Combining data on changes in travel activity with COVID-19 health outcomes and variation in state policy adoption, we characterize the direct impact of stay-at-home mandates on mobility and social distancing and link these behavioral changes to health benefits. We find evidence of dramatic declines in mobility nationwide prior to the adoption of statewide mandates. Despite these early reductions, we find that statewide stay-at-home policies induced ""mandate effects"" of between 4.1 and 5.9 percentage point declines relative to pre-COVID-19 levels for the first four states to introduce such policies. These effects persist when considering all states' mandates and alternate estimation strategies that account for states' differences in travel behavior prior to policy adoption. Using previous changes in mobility, we find significant effects on current mortality, with 1% reductions in visits to non-essential businesses weeks prior being associated with 9.2 fewer deaths per 100 million per day, corresponding with over 74,000 lives saved nationwide and resulting economic benefits between $249-$745 billion for observed behavioral changes in March and April. Observed reductions in mobility indeed contribute to flattening the curve and reduce the strain on the medical system during those two months. Our findings provide evidence that statewide stay-at-home ordinances induce additional social distancing, and ultimately attenuate the negative health consequences of COVID-19, revealing themselves as important policy tools in the fight against pandemic. Further, substantial reductions in mobility prior to state-level policies convey important policy implications.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['University of California, Berkeley', 'University of California, Berk']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
6,Containing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Meteorological Factors and Control Strategies,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111468,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and the meteorological factors vary greatly across the world. Understanding the effect of meteorological factors and control strategies on COVID-19 transmission is critical to contain the epidemic. Using individual-level data in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and the number of confirmed cases in other regions, we explore the effect of temperature, relative humidity, and control measures on the spread of COVID-19. We found that high temperature mitigates the transmission of the disease. High relative humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is high. Implementing classical control measures can dramatically slow the spread of the disease. However, due to the occurrence of pre-symptomatic infections, the effect of the measures to shorten onset-to-isolation time is markedly reduced and the importance of contact tracing and quarantine and social distancing increases. The analytic results also highlight the importance of early intervention to contain the spread of COVID-19.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"[""Xi'an Jiaotong University"", 'Northwestern Polytechnical University', ""Chang'an University""]",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,

It also examines the implementation of national guidance in COVID-19 tracheostomies and the incidence of COVID-19 infections amongst those health care workers involved in the procedure. An invitation to participate in an online survey tool (REDCap) was disseminated to all UK NHS departments involved in tracheostomy in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients via the Federation of Surgical Specialty Associations, it's subsidiary organisations and the Intensive Care Society. To date 78 hospitals have submitted 564 COVID-19 tracheostomy cases. Fifty-two percent (n=219/465) of patients who had undergone tracheostomy and were still alive, had been successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation at the point of completing the survey. The all cause in-hospital mortality following tracheostomy was 12% (n=62/530), with 3% of these (n=2/62) due to tracheostomy related complications and the remaining deaths due to COVID-19 related complications. Amongst 400 cases submitting data two weeks after the tracheostomy, no instance of COVID-19 infection amongst operators was recorded. FFP3 masks or Powered Air Purifying Respirators were used by operators in 100% of tracheostomies and a face visor or hood with face shield was available in 99% of cases. This interim report highlights early outcomes following tracheostomy in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Future reporting from COVIDTrach will include more detailed analysis at later timepoints using comparator groups in order to provide a more comprehensive assessment of tracheostomy in COVID-19.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['', 'University College London']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
9,The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely comodulated by temperature and by relative humidity,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111278,"Quantifying the role of temperature and humidity on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confounded by a lack of controlled experiments, the sudden rise in detection rates, and changing weather patterns. In this paper we focus our analysis on data from Colombia, which presents unique economic, demographic and geological characteristics that favor the study of temperature and humidity upon SARS-CoV-2 transmission: the weather varies dramatically across five natural regions (from the Caribbean coast and the Amazon rainforest to the Andean mountains), there are no pronounced seasons, there is a central port of entry, the use of public transportation dominates inter- and intracity travel, and indoor climate control is rare. While only controlled experiments can precisely quantify the role of temperature and humidity upon SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we observe significant attenuation of transmission in climates with sustained daily maximum temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius and simultaneous mean relative humidity below 78%.

10,Noninvasive respiratory support in acute hypoxemicrespiratory failure associated with COVID-19 and other viralinfections,10.1101/2020.05.24.20111013,"Introduction: Noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) such as noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and high flow nasal therapy (HFNT) have been used in the treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and other viral infections. However, there is a lack of consensus in favor of or against NRS use due to the risks of worsening hypoxemia, intubation delay, and aerosols environmental contamination associated with the use of these tools. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the use of NRS in adult patients with COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia (i.e. H1N1, SARS, MERS) and AHRF. We also searched for studies evaluating the risk of aerosolization/contamination with these tools. Evidence Acquisition: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed EMBASE and two major preprint servers (biorXiv and medRxiv) from inception to April 14, 2020, for studies on the use of respiratory support in AHRF and viral pneumonia. Evidence Synthesis: The search identified 4086 records and we found only one randomized controlled trial out of 58 studies included, with great variabilities in support utilization and failure rates. Fifteen studies explored the issue of aerosolization/contamination showing a high risk of airborne transmission via droplets generation during the use of these modalities Conclusions: Use of NRS and treatment failure in the context of COVID-19 and viral infection associated-AHRF, varied widely.

11,Worldwide and Regional Forecasting of Coronavirus (Covid-19) Spread using a Deep Learning Model,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111039,"In December 2019, Covid-19 epidemic was identified in Wuhan, China. Covid-19 may cause fatality especially among elderly, and people with chronic health problems. After human to human transmissions of the disease, it has rapidly spread throughout China, and then the outbreak has reached to neighboring countries in Asia. Now, the spread of the virus is accelerating in the world, and increasing number of new cases has been reported daily in Europe, Middle East, Africa and America regions. Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) also announced Covid-19 as a Pandemic. As of 3 April, worldwide around more than 1 million cases and around 60,000 fatalities are reported. Thus, forecasting regional and worldwide outbreak size of Covid-19 is important in order to take necessary actions regarding to preparedness plans and mitigation interventions. In this work, we design a deep learning model, which is an effective artificial intelligence method, to provide regional and worldwide forecasts. Particularly for worldwide, our approach predicts the cumulative number of cases, cumulative number of deaths and daily new cases. For Europe and Middle East regions, we predict the cumulative number of cases, and for Mainland China we predict daily new cases and the cumulative number of deaths. We predict the next 10 days based on the previously reported actual time series data of Covid-19. For worldwide forecasts, we use the data provided by Worldometers. For Europe and Middle East forecasts, we use the data provided by World Health Organization, and for China Mainland forecasts, the data is obtained from Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the first time that a deep learning model has been employed for Covid-19 spread prediction, solely based on the known reported cases of Covid-19. The proposed deep learning architecture consists of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layers to predict regional and worldwide forecasts. We evaluate our approach with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. For forecasting, we use the network models that give the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days of actual data. Networks, which achieves the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days, are used to predict the next 10 days. Every day, the spread and situations are changing. Our approach can take into account these real-time changes; the deep learning model can be re-trained with new daily data and perform real-time forecasting. Results show that the proposed deep learning model is promising, it can predict possible scenarios regionally and globally for the spread of Covid-19.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['Middle East Technical University - Northern Cyprus Campus', 'Near East University']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
12,Global lessons and Potential strategies in combating COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia:Systematic Review,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111062,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease that has been classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative public health strategies to control the spread. Here, we have conducted an online search for all relevant public health interventions for COVID-19. We then characterize and summarize the global COVID-19 pandemic situation and recommend potential mitigation strategies in the context of Ethiopia. Methods: Initial search of Pub Med central and Google scholar was undertaken followed by analysis of the text words; COVID-19,SARS-CoV-2, Global lessons and Pandemic; A second search using all identified keywords including COVID-19, Epidemiology, Sociocultural, Ethiopia; thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles were searched. Accordingly, of the 1,402 articles, 39 were included in the analysis for this review. Result: Countries COVID-19 mitigation strategies widely varied. The most common global COVID-19 mitigation strategies include; whole of government approach including individual, community and environmental measures, detecting and isolating cases, contact tracing and quarantine, social and physical distancing measures including for mass gatherings and international travel measures. Models revealed that, social and physical distancing alone could prevent the pandemic from 60-95%, if timely and effectively implemented. Moreover, detecting and isolation of cases were found to be crucial while access to testing was found to the global challenge. Individual measures including proper hand washing were also reported to be effective measures in preventing the pandemic. Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 ranged from 25% to 80% and as a result, countries are revising the case definition for early detection of mild symptomatic cases of COVID-19 with inclusion of Chills, Muscle pain and new loss of taste or smell in addition to Cough, Shortness of breath, Fever and Sore throat. Global reports also revealed that the incubation period of COVID-19 could go to 24 days. Ethiopia is also unique in the aspects of sociocultural prospects while more than 99.3% of the population has a religion. Moreover, 69% of the population is under the age of 29 years old and the health policy in the country focused on prevention and primary health care. All these could be potential entries and opportunities to combat COVID-19 pandemic in the context of Ethiopia. Conclusion: While recommendations may change depending on the level of outbreak, we conclude that in Most countries have benefited from early interventions and in setups like Africa including Ethiopia where health system capability is limited, community engagement supported by local evidence with strict implementation of social and physical distancing measures is mandatory. Active involvement of religious Institutions and mobilizing youth could be entry to increase public awareness in mitigating COVID-19. Community level case detection could enhance early identification of cases which could be implemented through the health extension program. Isolation and quarantine beyond 14 days could help identify long term carriers of COVID-19. Validation and use of rapid test kits could be vital to increase access for testing. Revision of case definitions for COVID-19 could be important for early detection and identification of mild symptomatic cases.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['Ethiopian Public Health Institute', 'Clinton Health Access Initiative', 'ICAP-Ethiopia', ""St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical Collage"", 'Global One Health Initiative,East Africal Regional office']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,

We assessed the diffusion of the virus via testing plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 3985 employees of 7 different hospitals, located across the Lombardy region in areas with different exposure to the epidemic. Subjects filled an anamnestic questionnaire to self-report on COVID-19 symptoms, co-morbidities, smoking, regular or smart-working, and the exposure to COVID-19-infected individuals. We show that the number of individuals exposed to the virus depended on the geographical area where the hospital was located and ranged between 3 to 43% which correlated with the incidence of COVID-19 in Lombardy. There was a higher prevalence of females than males positive for IgG, however the level of antibodies was similar, suggesting a comparable magnitude of the response. We observed 10% of IgG positive asymptomatic individuals and another 20% with one or two symptoms. 81% of individuals presenting both anosmia/ageusia and fever resulted SARS-CoV-2 infected.

Conflicting findings have raised concerns regarding the association of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) use with likelihood or severity of infection during this pandemic. Objective: To study the cumulative evidence for association of ACEI/ARB use with outcomes among patients with confirmed Covid-19. Methods: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were thoroughly searched from November 01, 2019 to May 15, 2020 for studies reporting on outcomes based on ACEI/ARB use in patients with confirmed Covid-19. Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines were used for the present study. Relevant data was collected and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects model. Main Outcome measures: In-hospital mortality was the primary end of interest. Second end-point was severe or critical illness defined as either need for intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, or mortality. Results: Fifteen studies with total of 23,822 patients (N ACEI/ARB=6,650) were included in the present analysis. Overall, prevalence of ACEI/ARB use ranged from 7.7% to 46.2% across studies. Among 10 studies, patients using ACEI/ARB had similar odds of mortality [OR 1.03 (0.69-1.55)] and severe or critical illness [1.18 (0.91-1.54)] compared to those not on ACEI/ARB. In an analysis restricted to patients with hypertension, ACEI/ARB use was associated with significantly lower mortality [0.64 (0.45-0.89)], while the odds of severe/critical illness [0.76(0.52-1.12); p=0.16] remained non-significant compared with non-ACEI/ARB users. Conclusion: There is no evidence for increased risk of severe illness or mortality in patients using ACEI/ARB compared with non-users.

We developed and validated new anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA tests (ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a.) based on whole-virus antigens. We used a total of 553 serum samples including samples from COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases, healthy donors, and patients positive for other infections or autoimmune conditions. Overall, the assays showed good concordance with the indirect immunofluorescence reference test in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Especially for IgG and IgA, we observed high sensitivity (92.5 and 93.6%, respectively); specificity was high (>96%) for all antibody types ELISAs. In addition, sensitivity was linked to the days from symptoms onset (DSO) due to the seroconversion window, and for ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs resulted 100% in those samples collected after 10 and 12 DSO, respectively. The results showed that ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs may represent a valid option for both diagnostic and epidemiological purposes, covering all different antibody types developed in SARS-CoV-2 immune response.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['National Institute of Infectious Diseases ""Spallanzani""', 'DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a.']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,

19,Diagnostic performance of CT and its key signs for COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1101/2020.05.24.20111773,"Abstract Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of chest CT in 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR)as a reference standard. At the same time, the imaging features of CT in confirmed COVID-19 patients would be summarized. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of 5 electronic databases was performed. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated using the random-effects model and the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. We also conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled incidence of the chest CT imaging findings and the 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Meta-regression analysis was used to explore the source of heterogeneity. Results: Overall, 25 articles comprising 4,857 patients were included. The pooled sensitivity of CT was 93% (95% CI, 89-96%) and specificity was 44% (95% CI, 27-62%). The area under the SROC curve was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.96). For the RT-PCR assay, the pooled sensitivity of the initial test and the missed diagnosis rate after the second-round test were 76% (95% CI: 59-89%; I2=96%) and 26% (95% CI: 14-39%; I2=45%), respectively. According to the subgroup analysis, the diagnostic sensitivity of CT in Hubei was higher than that in other regions. Besides, the most common patterns on CT imaging finding was ground glass opacities (GGO) 58% (95% CI: 49-70%), followed by air bronchogram 51% (95% CI: 31-70%). Lesions were inclined to distribute in peripheral 64% (95% CI: 49-78%), and the incidence of bilateral lung involvement was 69% (95% CI: 58-79%). Conclusions: There were still several cases of missed diagnosis after multiple RT-PCR examinations. In high-prevalence areas, CT could be recommended as an auxiliary screening method for RT-PCR.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University', 'The first affiliated hospital of guangxi medical university']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
20,"Age, gender and COVID-19 infections",10.1101/2020.05.24.20111765,"Data for ten European countries which provide detailed distribution of COVID-19 cases by sex and age show that among people of working age, women diagnosed with COVID-19 substantially outnumber infected men. This pattern reverses around retirement: infection rates among women fall at age 60-69, resulting in a cross-over with infection rates among men. The relative disadvantage of women peaks at ages 20-29, whereas the male disadvantage in infection rates peaks at ages 70-79. The elevated infection rates among women of working age are likely tied to their higher share in health- and care-related occupations. Our examination also suggests a link between women's employment profiles and infection rates in prime working ages.

21,Effect of socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics on COVID-19 infection: The case of the Ultra-Orthodox and the Arab communities in Israel,10.1101/2020.05.25.20111575,"Background. During infectious disease outbreaks the weakest communities are more vulnerable to the infection and its deleterious effects. In Israel, the Arab and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities have unique demographic and cultural characteristics that place them at risk for infection. Objective. To examine the socioeconomic and ethnic differences in relation to COVID-19 testing, cases and deaths, and to analyze infection spread patterns in ethnically diverse communities. Methods. Consecutive data on COVID-19 diagnostic testing, confirmed cases and deaths collected from March 31st through May 1st, 2020 in 174 localities across Israel (84% of the population) were analyzed by socioeconomic ranking and ethnicity. Findings. Tests were performed on 331,594 individuals (4.29% of the total population). Of those, 14,865 individuals (4.48%) were positive and 203 died (1.37% of confirmed cases). The percentage of the population tested was 26% and the risk of testing positive was 2.16 times higher in the lowest, compared with the highest socioeconomic category. The proportion of confirmed cases was 4.96 times higher in the Jewish compared with the Arab population. The rate of confirmed cases in 2 Ultra-Orthodox localities increased relatively early and quickly. Other Jewish and Arab localities showed consistently low rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases, regardless of socioeconomic ranking. Interpretation Culturally different communities reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak and to government measures, resulting in different outcomes. Therefore, socioeconomic and ethnic variables cannot fully explain communities reaction to the pandemic. Our findings stress the need for designing a culturally adapted approach for dealing with health crises.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['Gertner Institute for Epidemiology & Health Policy Research', 'Bar ilan university', 'Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheba, Israel', 'Gertner Institue of Epidemiology & Health Policy Research']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,

This study aimed to investigate the potential associations of obesity and diabetes with COVID19 severe outcomes, assessed as ICU admittance. Subjects: Demographic and patient characteristics from a retrospective cohort of 1158 patients hospitalized with COVID19 in a single center in Kuwait, along with their medical history, were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the associations between different variables and ICU admittance. Results: From the 1158 hospitalized patients, 271 (23.4%) had diabetes, 236 (20.4%) had hypertension and 104 (9%) required admittance into the ICU. From patients with available measurements, 157 (21.6%) had body mass index (BMI)[&ge;]25 kg/m2. Univariate analysis showed that overweight (BMI=25.0~29.9 kg/m2), obesity class I (BMI=30~34.9 kg/m2) and morbid obesity (BMI[&ge;]40 kg/m2) associated with ICU admittance (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence intervals (CI)]: 2.45 [1.26~4.74] p value=0.008; OR [95% CI]: 3.51 [1.60~7.69] p value=0.002; and OR [95% CI]: 5.18 [1.50~17.85] p value=0.009], respectively). Patients with diabetes were more likely to be admitted to ICU (OR [95% CI]: 9.38 [5.49~16.02]). Two models for multivariate regression analysis were used, assessing either BMI or diabetes on ICU outcomes. In the BMI model, class I obesity and morbid obesity were associated with ICU admittance (adjusted OR (AOR) [95% CI]: 2.7 [1.17~6.20] p value=0.019 and AOR [95% CI]: 3.95 [1.00~15.20] p value=0.046, respectively). In the diabetes model, diabetes was associated with higher ICU admittance (AOR [95% CI]: 5.49 [3.13~9.65] p value<0.001) whereas hypertension had a protective effect on ICU admittance (AOR [95% CI]: 0.51 (0.28-0.91). Conclusions: In our cohort, overweight, obesity and diabetes in patients with COVID19 were associated with ICU admittance, putting these patients at higher risk of poor outcomes.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['COVID-19 Research Group, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, Kuwait', 'Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
23,Estimating Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111559,"Introduction and Goals: SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted both in the community and within households. Social distancing and lockdowns reduce community transmission but do not directly address household transmission. We provide quantitative measures of household transmission based on empirical data, and estimate the contribution of households to overall spread. We highlight policy implications from our analysis of household transmission, and more generally, of changes in contact patterns under social distancing. Methods: We investigate the household secondary attack rate (SAR) for SARS-CoV-2, as well as R_h, which is the average number of within-household infections caused by a single index case. We estimate the SAR through a meta-analysis of previous studies. Taking a Bayesian approach, we correct estimates for the false-negative rate (FNR) of testing and compute posterior credible intervals for SAR. We estimate R_h using results from population testing in Vo', Italy and contact tracing data that we curate from Singapore. The code and data behind our analysis are publicly available at: https://github.com/andrewilyas/covid-household-transmission. Results: Our analysis of eight recent attack rate studies yields an SAR estimate of 0.28 (0.10, 0.61). From contact tracing data, we infer an R_h value of 0.32 (0.22, 0.42). Blanket testing data from Vo' yields an R_h estimate of 0.37 (0.34, 040) and a CRI estimate of 0.5 after correcting for FNR and asymptomatic cases. Interpretation: Our estimates of R_h suggest that household transmission was a small fraction (5%-35%) of R before social distancing but a large fraction after (30%-55%). This suggests that household transmission may be an effective target for interventions. A remaining uncertainty is whether household infections actually contribute to further community transmission or are contained within households. This can be estimated given high-quality contact tracing data. More broadly, our study points to emerging contact patterns (i.e., increased time at home relative to the community) playing a role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We briefly highlight another instance of this phenomenon (differences in contact between essential workers and the rest of the population), provide coarse estimates of its effect on transmission, and discuss how future data could enable a more reliable estimate.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['UC Berkeley', 'MIT', 'University of Oxford']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,

We have proposed this approach and developed it in [1,2,3] for separability and grouping step in SSA, which plays an important role for reconstruction and forecasting in the SSA. The modified SSA mainly enables us to identify the number of the interpretable components required for separability, signal extraction and noise reduction. The approach was examined using different number of simulated and real data with different structures and signal to noise ratio. In this study we examine its capability in analysing COVID-19 data. Then, we use Vector SSA for predicting new data points and the peak of this pandemic. The results shows that the approach can be used as a promising one in decomposing and forecasting the daily cases of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,['King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences'],,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,

Design, Setting, and Participants Nationwide population-based cohort of all 228.677 consecutive Danish individuals tested (positive or negative) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA from the identification of the first COVID-19 case on February 27th, 2020 until April 30th, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures We examined characteristics and predictors of inpatient hospitalization versus community-management, and death versus survival, adjusted for age-, sex- and number of comorbidities. Results We identified 9,519 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases of whom 78% were community-managed, 22% were hospitalized (3.2% at an intensive care unit) and 5.5% had died within 30 days. Median age varied from 45 years (interquartile range (IQR) 31-57) among community-managed cases to 82 years (IQR 75-89) among those who died. Age was a strong predictor of fatal disease (odds ratio (OR) 14 for 70-79-year old, OR 26 for 80-89-year old, and OR 82 for cases older than 90 years, when compared to 50-59-year old and adjusted for sex and number of comorbidities). Similarly, the number of comorbidities was strongly associated with fatal disease (OR 5.2, for cases with [&ge;]4 comorbidities versus no comorbidities), and 82% of fatal cases had at least 2 comorbidities. A wide range of major chronic diseases were associated with hospitalization with ORs ranging from 1.3-1.4 (e.g. stroke, ischemic heart disease) to 2.2-2.7 (e.g. heart failure, hospital-diagnosed kidney disease, chronic liver disease). Similarly, chronic diseases were associated with mortality with ORs ranging from 1.2-1.3 (e.g. ischemic heart disease, hypertension) to 2.4-2.7 (e.g. major psychiatric disorder, organ transplantation). In the absence of comorbidities, mortality was relatively low (5% or less) in persons aged up to 80 years. Conclusions and Relevance In this first nationwide population-based study, increasing age and number of comorbidities were strongly associated with hospitalization requirement and death in COVID-19. In the absence of comorbidities, the mortality was, however, lowest until the age of 80 years. These results may help in accurate identification, triage and protection of high-risk groups in general populations, i.e. when reopening societies.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['University of Southern Denmark', 'Aarhus University Hospital', 'Danish Medicines Agency', 'Statens Serum Institut', 'Aarhus University']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
26,1-C Nonlinear Covid-19 Epidemic Model and Application to the Epidemic Prediction in France,10.1101/2020.05.24.20111807,"We have shown in a previous paper that the standard time-invariant SIR model was not effective to predict the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic propagation. We have proposed a new model predicting z the logarithm of the number of detected-contaminated people. It follows a linear dynamical system z'= b-a z. We show here that we can improve this prediction using a non linear model z' = b-a z^r where r is an exponent that we have also to estimate from data. Some countries have an epidemic with a bell shaped form that we call unimodal epidemic. With this new model, we fit observed data of different countries having an unimodal epidemic with a surprising quality. We discuss also the prediction quality obtained with these models at the epidemic start in France. Finally, we evaluate the containment impact on the Covid French mortality in hospitals.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,['Retired from INRIA'],,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
27,Comparison of epidemic control strategies using agent-based simulations,10.1101/2020.05.24.20111625,"A simulation of the dynamics of a small population is used to assess the impact of different confinement and testing strategies in the control of an epidemic. The simulation considers individuals as agents moving randomly across the habitat according to predefined urban patterns. Agents carry a simple tracing device that identifies signals emitted by other agents, recording the position and time of the encounter. The information of every device is propagated daily to an epidemic observatory based on an online graph database. Infections are simulated as stochastic processes depending on the proximity among individuals. Different epidemic control strategies are tested with and without the information of the tracing device under several scenarios. We observe that the success of the strategies strongly depends on the duration of the period of infectiousness before the presence of symptoms and the fraction of asymptomatic agents. If these values are high, strategies based on the presence of symptoms or on testing campaigns can hardly contain the epidemic. Strategies using massive confinement of the agents are able to control the epidemic at the cost of sending a large fraction of the population into quarantine. In cases with moderate and low values for these parameters, the tracing devices can provide a slightly better performance but only if a large fraction of the agents carry the device. Otherwise, the impact of these devices is found to be negligible in comparison with other strategies not using them. Finally, we provide a methodology allowing to use the information of the graph database to estimate basic parameters of the disease such as the infection probability.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,['Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria'],,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
28,Visualizing the invisible: The effect of asymptomatic transmission on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111419,"Understanding the outbreak dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic has important implications for successful containment and mitigation strategies. Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model learns, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study reveals that the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 are sensitive to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups. For three distinct locations, Santa Clara County (CA, USA), New York City (NY, USA), and Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by May 13, 2020 to 6.2% (95% CI: 3.3%-9.0%), 22.7% (95% CI: 15.7%-29.8%), and 20.5% (95% CI: 17.0%-24.3%). Our method traces the initial outbreak date in Santa Clara County back to January 20, 2020 (95% CI: January 16, 2020 - January 24, 2020). Our results could significantly change our understanding and management of the COVID-19 pandemic: A large asymptomatic population will make isolation, containment, and tracing of individual cases challenging. Instead, if needed, managing community transmission through increasing population awareness, promoting physical distancing, and encouraging behavioral changes could become more relevant.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"['Stanford University', 'Universidad Catolica de Chile']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,
29,Predicting COVID-19 spread and public health needs to contain the pandemic in West-Africa,10.1101/2020.05.23.20111294,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is causing devastating demographic, social, and economic damage globally. Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West-Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West-Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West-Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to eliminate the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West-African COVID-19 data project a 60% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 53% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination, while disease elimination is also possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 2 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic humans are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 3 days then only about a 31% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures caused the time-dependent effective reproduction number to reduce by approximately 37% from February 28, to August 24, 2020. We conclude that COVID-19 elimination requires more control measures than what is currently being applied inWest-Africa and that mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early is very important in curtailing the burden of the pandemic.",5/26/2020,medrxiv,"[""Laboratoire de Biomathematiques et d'estimations Forestieres, University of Abomey-Calavi"", ""Laboratoire de Biomathematiques et d'Estimations Forestieres, University of Abomey-Calavi"", 'University of Florida']",,,,,,,,,,,rxiv,

Methods Through the review of the electronic medical records of Guizhou Jiangjunshan Hospital, clinical data of 6 patients were obtained. Three of the patients used convalescent plasma therapy for the first treatment, while the other three patients were used during in the recurrence. The efficacy of convalescent plasma depends on the relief of symptoms, changes in laboratory indicators and chest imaging abnormalities. Results The PaO2 / FiO2 and lymphocyte count of patients 1, 2 and 3 treated with convalescent plasma treatment for the first treatment period were changed from abnormal to normal. The levels of inflammation markers CRP and IL-6 of the patients decreased significantly. Chest imaging examination showed that the lung lesions gradually subsided. The relapsed patients (No. 4 and No. 6), after using convalescent plasma therapy, turned negative on two consecutive throat swab tests on Day 24 and Day 3, respectively. The basic condition of patient 4 with in the recurrence was too poor, and only one round of convalescent plasma transfusion was performed, so the laryngeal swab test paper has been consistently positive so far.
